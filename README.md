"Stage Size Changer" is a userscript for the Scratch[^1] website that allows you to change the stage size from 480Ã—360 to something else

The userscript adds:
* VM patches related to adding the ability to resize the stage
* A button in the stage controls to resize the stage
* A label in the stage controls that shows the position of the mouse cursor on the stage
* Blocks `have "Stage Size Changer"?`, `StageSC: stage width`, `StageSC: stage height`

### Example with 360Ã—640 stage size:
